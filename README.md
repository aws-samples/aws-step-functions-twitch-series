# AWS Step Functions

This repository contains the code created during the [AWS Step Functions][step-functions] series on [Twitch][twitch]. Every Tuesday at 2pm ET/11am PT we cover a bit of functionality live, so you can create workflows that are more effective and more efficient.

**Note**: All templates have been updated to reflect [AWS Serverless Application Model][sam] (AWS SAM) [support for Step Functions][sam-step-functions-support], launched on 27 May 2020. Wherever the templates in this repository and the video episodes differ, this repository should be considered correct.
